---functions of list---

--> 1-)You can change items without functions :
  
  fruits=["apple","orange",banana","strawberry"]
  fruits[2]="pear" 
  print(fruits)
  this process show that ["apple","orange","pear","strawberry"]

--> 2-)You can add items with 3 different ways :
    
       first way = you don't have to use function:
       
         skills=["listening","speaking","grammar"]
         skills + ["vocabulary","writing"]
         print(skills)
         this process show that ["listening","speaking","grammar","vocabulary","writing"]
    
        second way = you can use function which is append :
        
          brands=["pazar","defacto",lcwaiki"]
          brands.append["koton"]
          print(brands)
          this show that ["pazar","defacto","lcwaiki","koton"]

        third way = you can use function which is insert :
   
          >>!!! this function have to have two arguments first argument is index number , second argument is item.
          list = ["book","novel"]
          you want list to show that ["book","poem","novel"] so you know index number.
          so you can do this => list.insert(1,"poem")

--> 3-) how do you know length of list for this question there is a funtion whic is len() in py.
  
  numbers=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0]
  len(number)
  this method show 10 
  
  there is a one more way which more complicated for this question :
       
       i=0
       for i in numbers:
        i+=1
       print(i)

--> 4-) this function about insert because you have to use index number but how do you know index number of any item ? Ä°NDEX()
  
  kitchen = ["oven","fridge","plate","knife"]
  x = kitchen.index("fridge")
  print(x)
  if we do this process we will see 1.
  
--> 5-) sometimes item is more than one in the list so we have to know that how many times repeat this item ? COUNT() 
  
  numbers = [1,2,3,1,6,1,1]
  x = numbers.count(1)
  
--> 6-) REMOVE() we us this for remove items from the list.
  
  clothes = ["jean","shirt","jumper"]
  clothes.remove("shirt")
  print(clothes) this process show ["jean","jumper"] ( shirt was deleted in clothes )
  
--> 7-) you use function ,which sort(), to sort items :) :
  
  numbers = [3,2,1,5,8,7,6]
  number.sort()
  print(numbers)
  --> [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]

--> 8-) last function about list is reserve we can do it with 2 different ways :
  
  users = ["emre","yusuf","mustafa"]
  
  first way : use reserve() :
    
    users.serve() --> ["mustafa","yusuf","emre"]
  
  second way : use [::-1] :
     
    for example : emre[::-1] --> "erme" so you can do this: 
    changed_list = list[::-1]
    print(changed_list)
